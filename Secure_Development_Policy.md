## 🔄 **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**

### **📋 Phase 1: Planning & Design**
- **🏷️ Project Classification:** Comprehensive classification per [Classification Framework](./CLASSIFICATION.md) including CIA triad, RTO/RPO, and business impact analysis
- **🏗️ Security Architecture:** Design patterns aligned with classification levels and business value requirements
- **📊 Risk Assessment:** Integration with [Risk Register](./Risk_Register.md) for classification-driven security decisions
- **💰 Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Security investments supporting **💰 cost efficiency** objectives based on classification ROI

### **💻 Phase 2: Development**
- **🛡️ Secure Coding Guidelines:** OWASP Top 10 and language-specific best practices aligned with project classification
- **🔍 Code Review Requirements:** Security-focused peer review for critical components based on integrity and confidentiality levels
- **🗂️ Asset Classification:** Apply [Data Classification Policy](./Data_Classification_Policy.md) and project classification to all code assets

- **📦 Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Automated dependency vulnerability scanning with SBOM generation
- **⚡ Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** OWASP ZAP scanning in staging environments based on classification levels
- **🔍 Secret Scanning:** Continuous monitoring for exposed credentials and keys with classification-based remediation SLAs

#### **🔒 Protection of Test Data**
- **🚫 Prohibition on Production Data:** The use of personal or sensitive production data in development or test environments is strictly prohibited.
- **🎭 Data Anonymization & Masking:** Where data structurally similar to production data is required for testing, it MUST be anonymized, pseudonymized, or masked to remove all sensitive elements.
- **🗑️ Secure Deletion:** Test data MUST be securely deleted from test environments upon completion of testing.
- **🔐 Access Control:** Access to test environments and data is restricted based on the principle of least privilege.

### **🤖 AI-Augmented Development Controls**

All AI-assisted development activities (including GitHub Copilot, custom agents, and LLM-based tools) MUST follow these controls:

#### **🔐 AI as Proposal Generator, Not Authority**
- **All AI outputs are proposals:** AI-generated code, documentation, and configurations require human review and approval
- **No autonomous deployment:** AI may not bypass CI/CD pipelines, security gates, or approval workflows
- **Human accountability:** Responsibility for all changes remains with human developers, not AI tools

#### **📋 PR Review Requirements**
- **Mandatory human review:** All AI-assisted changes MUST pass through standard pull request workflows
- **Security gate enforcement:** CI pipelines unchanged or only tightened; AI may not weaken security controls
- **Change attribution:** PR descriptions MUST document AI assistance when used

#### **🔧 Curator-Agent as Tooling Change**
- **Configuration management:** Changes to `.github/agents/*.md`, `.github/copilot-mcp*.json`, `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` treated as Normal Changes per [Change Management](./Change_Management.md)
- **CEO approval required:** All curator-agent modifications to agent ecosystem require explicit CEO or designated security owner approval
- **Risk assessment:** Capability expansion or new integrations require documented risk evaluation

#### **🛡️ Security Requirements**
- **Tool permissions:** Agents operate with least-privilege tool access; capability expansion requires security review
- **MCP governance:** Model Context Protocol configurations require change control and security validation
- **Audit trail:** All agent activities logged and reviewable for compliance and security analysis
