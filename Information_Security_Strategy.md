## 🎯 **Strategic Purpose Statement**

**Hack23 AB** represents a new paradigm in technology companies - where enterprise-grade security expertise directly enables innovation rather than constraining it. This Information Security Strategy embodies our fundamental principle: **our ISMS is not separate from our business - it IS our business model.**

As a cybersecurity consulting company, our own security posture serves as both our operational foundation and our marketing demonstration. Every security control we implement, every process we document, and every risk we mitigate showcases our expertise to potential clients while protecting our own valuable assets.

Our commitment to **radical transparency** extends to this strategy itself - demonstrating that true security comes from robust processes, continuous improvement, and a culture where security considerations are integral to every business decision. We publish 70% of our ISMS publicly with only specific sensitive values (credentials, account numbers, financial amounts, contract pricing) redacted—proving that transparency enhances rather than diminishes security.

*— James Pether Sörling, CEO/Founder*

**Current Architecture:** Frontend-only web application with no authentication system. See [Security Architecture](https://github.com/Hack23/cia-compliance-manager/blob/main/docs/architecture/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Security Implications & Risk Acceptance:**
- The absence of an authentication system means all features and data are accessible to any user
- This architectural choice is accepted because the application processes only non-sensitive, public compliance framework data
- No user-specific or privileged operations are available; all actions are read-only compliance assessments
- The Low confidentiality classification reflects this intentional risk acceptance per [Classification Framework](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md)
- If future requirements include handling sensitive organizational data, authentication and access controls will be implemented accordingly
- Risk documented in [Risk Register](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Risk_Register.md) with periodic review
