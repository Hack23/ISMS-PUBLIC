---

## 🏢 **Single-Person Company Adaptation**

### **Traditional Multi-Person Requirement**

Industry best practice recommends a **Change Advisory Board (CAB)** composed of representatives from IT, security, operations, and business units to review and approve all high-risk changes before implementation. This provides:
- Multiple perspectives on change impact
- Independent review of technical decisions
- Segregation of duties between change requester and approver
- Collective accountability for change decisions

### **Hack23 AB Single-Person Adaptation**

As CEO/Founder (CISM/CISSP certified) performs all roles (developer, security officer, operator, business leader), traditional CAB is not possible. **Instead, Hack23 AB implements risk-proportional controls:**

#### **🎯 For Standard Changes (Pre-Approved)**
- **Automated Security Gates**: All changes pass comprehensive security validation (SAST, SCA, DAST, secret scanning)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing prevents untested code deployment
- **Immediate Implementation**: CEO deploys after automated checks pass
- **No Additional Review**: Pre-approval criteria met through automation

#### **🎯 For Normal Changes (CEO Review & Approval)**
- **CEO Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation using standardized template covering:
  - Security impact analysis
  - Business justification
  - Compliance validation
  - Cost-benefit analysis
  - Rollback planning
- **48-Hour Reflection Period**: Mandatory temporal separation for high-risk changes
  - Prevents impulsive decisions
  - Allows time for second thoughts
  - Can be documented and overridden for justified urgency
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Detailed change rationale enables future audit/review
- **Break-Glass Procedure**: Immediate change allowed for emergencies with enhanced logging and post-action review

#### **🎯 For Emergency Changes (Immediate Implementation)**
- **CEO Sole Authority**: Full decision-making power during active incidents
- **Complete Logging**: All actions timestamped with explicit rationale
- **4-Hour Documentation Window**: Full change record within 4 hours
- **24-Hour Post-Review**: Retrospective approval and lessons learned
- **Quarterly Retrospective**: Analysis of all emergency changes for patterns

### **Compensating Controls**

| Control Type | Implementation | ISO 27001 Alignment | Effectiveness |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **⏱️ Temporal Separation** | 48-hour minimum between risk assessment and implementation for high-risk changes | A.8.32 - Change Management | Prevents impulsive decisions, provides reflection time |
| **📊 Documentation Quality** | Detailed change rationale, risk analysis, and rollback plan required | A.5.37 - Documented Operating Procedures | Enables retrospective review and audit trail |
| **🤖 Automation Gates** | CI/CD testing, security scanning, compliance validation before deployment | A.8.32 - Change Management | Reduces human error, enforces security standards |
| **🔄 Quarterly Retrospective** | CEO reviews all changes for patterns, errors, or improvements | A.8.32 - Change Management | Continuous improvement, pattern detection |
| **📋 External Audit** | Annual validation of change management controls by external auditor | A.5.36 - Compliance Monitoring | Independent verification of control effectiveness |

### **ISO 27001:2022 Compliance**

This adaptation maintains the **control objectives** of **A.8.32 Change Management** by ensuring:

✅ **Authorized Changes Only**: CEO is the authorized approver with documented authority  
✅ **Risk-Assessed Changes**: All changes include documented risk analysis  
✅ **Tested Changes**: Automated testing gates prevent untested code deployment  
✅ **Documented Changes**: Git history + change log provide complete audit trail  
✅ **Controlled Implementation**: Temporal separation + rollback planning ensure control

**Alignment with ISO 27001:2022 Guidance**: Annex A.8.32 requires "planned and documented" change management with "appropriate controls." The standard explicitly allows controls to be tailored to organizational size and complexity. Single-person operations can achieve control objectives through **temporal separation**, **automation**, and **enhanced documentation** rather than **personnel separation**.

### **Risk Acceptance**

**Risk ID**: R-PROCESS-001 (documented in [Risk_Register.md](./Risk_Register.md))

**Risk Description**: Simplified change management process increases risk of **self-approval bias** compared to multi-person approval workflows. CEO may approve changes without sufficient critical analysis.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Likelihood**: Low (CEO has deep technical expertise - 15+ years cybersecurity experience including CISM/CISSP certifications)
- **Impact**: Moderate (potential for undetected errors in change decisions)
- **Risk Score**: 120 (Medium Risk per Risk Assessment Methodology)

**Risk Acceptance Rationale**:
- CEO technical expertise and certifications provide strong foundation for decision-making
- Temporal separation (48-hour reflection) provides opportunity for second thoughts
- Automated testing catches technical errors before deployment
- Quarterly retrospective enables pattern detection across changes
- Business velocity benefit outweighs marginal risk increase
- Heavy multi-person processes would be **operationally unsustainable** and create compliance theater

**Monitoring & Review**:
- **Quarterly Retrospective**: Comprehensive review of all Normal and Emergency changes for decision quality patterns
- **External Audit**: Annual validation by external auditor of change management control effectiveness
- **Metrics Tracking**: Change success rate, rollback frequency, security incidents correlated to changes
- **Continuous Improvement**: Process updates based on lessons learned from change outcomes

### **Business Value Demonstration**

This single-person adaptation demonstrates **cybersecurity consulting expertise** through:

🏆 **Competitive Advantage**: Risk-proportional controls showcase practical security engineering  
🤝 **Customer Trust**: Transparent documentation of single-person adaptations builds credibility  
💰 **Cost Efficiency**: Automated gates reduce manual review overhead while maintaining security  
🔄 **Operational Excellence**: Streamlined processes enable rapid deployment without sacrificing control  
💡 **Innovation Enablement**: Temporal separation allows thoughtful experimentation without bureaucracy  
🛡️ **Risk Reduction**: Automated security gates provide consistent validation exceeding manual review
