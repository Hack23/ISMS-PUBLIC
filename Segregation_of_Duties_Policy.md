## 🎯 **Purpose Statement**

In traditional multi-person organizations, segregation of duties prevents fraud and error by ensuring no single individual controls all aspects of a critical process. **Hack23 AB**, as a single-person company, demonstrates that the **security objectives** of segregation of duties can be achieved through innovative compensating controls: temporal separation, tool-based automation, immutable audit trails, and external validation.

This policy embodies our principle that **security through transparency** extends to acknowledging operational constraints while implementing rigorous controls that often exceed traditional multi-person separation. By documenting incompatible role combinations and their mitigations, we provide a template for other small organizations and demonstrate to clients our deep understanding of security principles.

*— James Pether Sörling, CEO/Founder*

---

## 🔍 **Purpose & Scope**

### Purpose
This policy implements **ISO 27001:2022 Control A.5.3 (Segregation of Duties)** by defining incompatible role combinations and establishing compensating controls that reduce opportunities for unauthorized or unintentional modification or misuse of organizational assets.

### Scope
This policy applies to:
- All business processes where conflicting duties could introduce risk
- All information systems documented in the [Asset Register](./Asset_Register.md)
- Financial, technical, governance, and operational activities
- CEO/Founder performing multiple roles with temporal and tool-based separation

---

## 🚫 **Segregation of Duties Matrix**

### 🎯 Principles

**ISO 27001:2022 Control A.5.3** requires segregation of duties to reduce opportunities for unauthorized or unintentional modification or misuse of the organization's assets. In a single-person organization like Hack23 AB, traditional role-based segregation is not possible. Instead, we implement **logical separation**, **temporal separation**, **tool-based controls**, and **compensating controls** to achieve the security objectives of this control.

This matrix documents:
- Incompatible role combinations that present security risks
- Compensating controls for single-person operations
- Automated and procedural safeguards
- External validation requirements

### 🔐 Incompatible Role Pairs

The following table identifies critical role combinations that must be separated through compensating controls:

**Example Major Changes:**
- Creating new Incident Response Plan procedures
- Adding mandatory security controls to Secure Development Policy
- Expanding scope of Data Classification Policy to cover new data types
- Modifying access control requirements in Access Control Policy

### **Minor Policy Updates (24-Hour Review Sufficient)**

Minor updates improve documentation quality without affecting security or business operations:

**Criteria (all of the following):**
- **No Security Impact**: Changes do not affect security controls or risk posture
- **No Scope Change**: Existing policy scope and requirements unchanged
- **Clarification Only**: Improves readability, corrects errors, or updates formatting
- **Easily Reversible**: Changes can be reverted with minimal impact

**Approval Process:**
1. **Draft**: CEO creates update with clear change description
2. **24-Hour Review**: Brief reflection period to identify unintended consequences
3. **Final Approval**: CEO approves after review period
4. **Version Control**: GitHub commit with change description (minor version increment)

**Example Minor Updates:**
- Correcting typos, grammar, or formatting inconsistencies
- Updating cross-references to other ISMS documents
- Clarifying existing requirements without changing intent
- Adjusting document metadata (review dates, version numbers)
- Fixing broken links or updating URLs
- Improving table formatting or diagram readability

## 🛡️ **Single-Person Organization Compensating Controls**

Given Hack23 AB's single-person structure, the following compensating controls ensure segregation of duties objectives are met:

### 1️⃣ **Risk-Based Temporal Separation**

Hack23 AB implements temporal separation based on change risk level rather than fixed waiting periods, enabling business agility while maintaining security rigor for high-risk activities.

#### **Temporal Separation Matrix**

| Risk Level | Minimum Separation | Examples | Justification |
|------------|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| **🔴 High Risk** | 48 hours | • Security configuration changes<br>• Financial approvals >50K SEK<br>• Critical infrastructure modifications<br>• Production database schema changes<br>• Access control policy modifications | Fraud/error potential justifies delay; irreversible consequences require reflection period |
| **🟡 Medium Risk** | 24 hours | • Code deployments to production<br>• Policy updates (non-security)<br>• Access grants to sensitive systems<br>• Supplier contracts <100K SEK/year<br>• Medium-impact infrastructure changes | Balance risk mitigation with business velocity; reversible if issues detected |
| **🟢 Low Risk** | Same-day (0 hours) | • Bug fixes and patches<br>• Documentation updates<br>• Typo corrections and formatting<br>• Routine operational tasks<br>• Financial transactions <5K SEK | Minimal risk; enhanced logging sufficient; delays harm business more than protect |

#### **Risk Classification Guidelines**

**High-Risk Change Criteria (any of the following):**
- Affects authentication, authorization, or encryption systems
- Modifies security monitoring or audit logging
- Changes critical business processes (financial, legal, regulatory)
- Impacts data classified as High/Very High confidentiality
- Financial value >50K SEK or contractual commitment >100K SEK/year
- Affects business-critical systems with RTO ≤4 hours

**Medium-Risk Change Criteria (any of the following):**
- Modifies production application code or infrastructure
- Updates policies affecting multiple stakeholders
- Grants access to systems containing sensitive data
- Changes with moderate financial impact (5K-50K SEK)
- Affects systems with RTO 4-24 hours

**Low-Risk Change Criteria (all of the following):**
- Does not affect security controls or sensitive data
- Easily reversible with minimal impact
- Financial value <5K SEK
- Affects non-critical systems or documentation only
- Well-tested with automated validation passing

### 2️⃣ **Tool-Based Separation**
- **GitHub**: Enforces different author/reviewer for pull requests via branch protection
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated gates prevent deployment without passing tests (unit 80%+, E2E, SAST, SCA)
- **AWS Services**: 
  - CloudTrail provides immutable audit logs
  - AWS Config monitors configuration changes
  - GuardDuty detects anomalous activity
  - IAM Access Analyzer identifies excessive permissions
  - AWS Backup automates validation

### 3️⃣ **Audit Trail Preservation**

All critical business activities maintain immutable audit trails through automated systems that prevent tampering or deletion:

#### **Comprehensive Audit Trail Controls**

| Audit Category | Implementation | Retention | Immutability Mechanism |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Code & Policies** | GitHub version control with branch protection | Permanent | No force-push allowed; full commit history preserved |
| **Infrastructure Changes** | AWS CloudTrail + S3 Object Lock | 90 days minimum | Object Lock prevents deletion; encrypted backup to separate account |
| **Financial Transactions** | Bokio accounting + SEB bank statements | 7 years (regulatory) | Independent third-party records; cannot be modified by CEO |
| **CI/CD Execution** | GitHub Actions logs + workflow history | 90 days | Automated logging; captured before deployment authorization |

**Previous Separate Controls (Now Consolidated):**
- ~~CloudTrail immutable logs~~ → Included in Infrastructure Changes above
- ~~S3 Object Lock backup~~ → Included in Infrastructure Changes above  
- ~~GitHub commit history~~ → Included in Code & Policies above
- ~~Bokio financial records~~ → Included in Financial Transactions above

**Result:** 4 audit trail controls organized into comprehensive control category for clarity (no security reduction, improved documentation structure)

### 4️⃣ **External Validation**

External validation provides independent oversight for high-risk decisions while maintaining pragmatic thresholds for routine business activities.

#### **Mandatory External Validation (Cannot Skip)**
- **GDPR Compliance Changes**: Legal counsel review for privacy policy modifications, data processing agreements
- **Cyber Liability Risk Assessments**: Insurance provider validation for significant risk changes
- **Critical Financial Transactions**: Bank reconciliation review for transactions >50K SEK
- **Major Supplier Contracts**: Legal counsel review for contracts >100K SEK/year or critical services
- **High-Severity Security Incidents**: External incident response consultant for CEO-involved incidents

#### **Optional External Validation (Recommended but Not Required)**
- **Strategic Partner Feedback**: Business decisions and partnership opportunities
- **Open Source Community Review**: Public GitHub repositories enable peer review of security practices
- **Risk Assessment Consultation**: Informal peer consultation on risk ratings for medium-severity risks
- **Quarterly Security Audits**: Planned external audits (aspirational, not mandatory for all quarters)

#### **Risk-Based Threshold**
External validation is required when a decision meets **both** of the following criteria:
- **Risk Score ≥8/10** (using CVSS-style likelihood × impact scale)
- **High/Critical Impact** on confidentiality, integrity, or availability (per [CLASSIFICATION.md](./CLASSIFICATION.md))

#### **Automated External Validation Tools**
The following tools provide continuous external validation without manual overhead:
- **OpenSSF Scorecard**: Independent security posture assessment (target: ≥9.0/10)
- **SonarCloud**: Automated code quality and security analysis
- **Dependabot**: Vulnerability scanning and dependency analysis
- **FOSSA**: License compliance and supply chain security
- **AWS Security Hub**: Aggregated security findings from multiple AWS services

### 5️⃣ **Knowledge Documentation & Transfer**
- **Founder Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive business continuity documentation per [Founder_Knowledge_Transfer_Template.md](./templates/Founder_Knowledge_Transfer_Template.md)
- **Quarterly Knowledge Review**: Systematic update of critical business knowledge for strategic partner emergency handoff
- **Break-Glass Procedures**: Documented emergency access procedures for business continuity scenarios
- **Partner Knowledge Validation**: Semi-annual testing of strategic partner ability to execute emergency procedures (see [Business_Continuity_Plan.md](./Business_Continuity_Plan.md))
- **Risk Mitigation**: Addresses R-FOUNDER-001 (Single-Person Dependency) in [Risk_Register.md](./Risk_Register.md)

### 6️⃣ **Automated Anomaly Detection**
- **AWS GuardDuty**: Continuous threat detection across AWS accounts
- **AWS Security Hub**: Aggregates findings from multiple security tools
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Alerts on unusual activity patterns (failed logins, IAM changes, large data transfers)
- **GitHub Advanced Security**: Secret scanning, dependency vulnerability alerts

```

**Key Workflow Improvements:**
- **Risk-Based Temporal Separation**: High (48h) → Medium (24h) → Low (0h) based on change risk classification
- **Automated Validation**: Medium-risk changes leverage automated gates before CEO approval
- **Enhanced Logging for Low-Risk**: Same-day implementation allowed with comprehensive audit trail
- **External Review Threshold**: Only required for high-risk changes with risk score ≥8/10
- **Simplified Path**: Low-risk changes follow streamlined process without artificial delays

## 🚨 **Break-Glass Procedures**

In emergency situations where normal segregation controls might delay critical response, Hack23 AB provides pragmatic break-glass procedures that balance urgency with accountability.

### **Break-Glass Criteria (Emergency Actions Without Normal Separations)**

**Authorized emergency scenarios:**
1. **🚨 Active Security Incidents**: Active threats requiring immediate response to prevent or contain damage
2. **⏰ Critical System Failures**: RTO breach imminent; customer-impacting outages requiring emergency fix
3. **🤝 Customer Escalations**: Customer demands immediate fix for critical issue affecting their operations or contract commitments
4. **💼 Time-Sensitive Business Opportunities**: Proposal deadlines, partnership negotiations, competitive responses requiring rapid deployment
5. **⚖️ Regulatory Deadlines**: Legal/regulatory filing deadlines that cannot be met with normal procedures
6. **👤 Founder Unavailability Emergency**: Strategic partner emergency activation per [Partnership Framework](./Partnership_Framework.md)

### **Compensating Controls for Break-Glass Actions**

**Enhanced Logging Requirements:**
- **Detailed Justification**: Document specific business impact that justified bypassing normal controls
- **Timestamp Recording**: Capture exact time of decision and action execution
- **Risk Assessment**: Brief assessment of decision risk vs. delay risk
- **Alternative Analysis**: Document why normal procedures were insufficient

**Post-Action Review Process:**
- **Review Timeline**: Within **7 days** of break-glass activation (relaxed from 72 hours for operational pragmatism)
- **External Review**: Engage external party (insurance provider, legal counsel, security consultant) if available and appropriate
- **Lessons Learned**: Document what worked, what could improve, and process updates needed
- **Control Validation**: Verify break-glass did not compromise other security controls

### **Key Principle**
Break-glass procedures exist to prevent process from harming business competitiveness or customer relationships. CEO judgment is trusted with accountability through comprehensive logging and post-action review.

### **Partnership Emergency Activation**

For founder unavailability emergencies (illness, incapacitation, burnout), break-glass procedures are integrated with strategic partnership activation:

- **Emergency Runbook**: [Partnership Emergency Activation Runbook](./templates/Partnership_Emergency_Activation_Runbook.md) provides 4-hour RTO procedures
- **Access Delegation**: Strategic partners receive emergency access via 1Password Emergency Kit
- **System Access**: Partner break-glass access includes GitHub (Owner), AWS (Administrator), Email (Full), Bokio (Read)
- **Logging Requirement**: All partnership activations logged in `emergency-activation-[DATE].md` file
- **Post-Activation Review**: Within 7 days of founder return, review activation with partner and emergency contact

**Cross-References:**
- [🤝 Strategic Partnership Framework](./Partnership_Framework.md) - Emergency Overflow Protocol
- [🔄 Business Continuity Plan](./Business_Continuity_Plan.md) - Founder Unavailability Scenario
- [📉 Risk Register](./Risk_Register.md) - R-FOUNDER-001 (Single-Person Dependency)

- **Control Pass Rate**: ≥95% of controls passing validation (target: 21/22 controls, allowing 1 control to fail while maintaining 95% threshold)
- **Remediation Timeliness**: <30 days for critical controls, <60 days for non-critical
- **Monthly Spot-Check Compliance**: 100% monthly spot-checks completed
- **Automated Control Uptime**: 99%+ availability for tool-based controls

### **Validation Reporting**

Validation results are reported in:
- **Risk Register**: R-FOUNDER-001 monitoring section tracks validation completion rate as Key Risk Indicator (KRI)
- **Security Metrics**: SoD control effectiveness KPIs track pass rate and validation completion
- **Compliance Checklist**: ISO 27001:2022 A.5.3 compliance status updated based on validation results

### **Escalation Process**

- **Control Failure**: CEO investigates and creates remediation plan within 5 business days
