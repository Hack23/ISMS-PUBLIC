## 🤝 **Why Radical Transparency?**

Hack23 AB's **70% public ISMS** (only credentials, account numbers, and financial details redacted) represents a strategic competitive advantage:

**🏆 For Clients:**
- **Accelerated Trust:** Self-service security validation eliminates lengthy diligence questionnaires
- **Proof of Expertise:** Live demonstration of enterprise-grade security implementation
- **Transparency Accountability:** Public commitment to security excellence drives continuous improvement

**🏛️ For Auditors:**
- **Audit Efficiency:** Pre-packaged evidence is estimated to reduce audit preparation time by up to 60%
- **Framework Alignment:** Clear ISO 27001, NIST CSF, CIS Controls mappings with live evidence
- **Continuous Validation:** Real-time OpenSSF Scorecard, SonarCloud, FOSSA results

**💼 Business Impact:**
- Target: compress sales cycles from 6 months → 3 months
- Premium pricing justified by demonstrable security maturity
- Competitive moat: transparency barrier competitors cannot replicate without similar investment

**"True security comes from robust processes and continuous improvement, not from hiding our methodologies."**  
— James Pether Sörling, CEO/CISO

## 🎯 **Executive Statement**

**Welcome to Hack23 AB's comprehensive ISMS documentation.** Founded in **June 2025** (Organization Number: 559534-7807), Hack23 AB operates as a Swedish cybersecurity consulting company demonstrating radical transparency through our industry-first public ISMS.

**🏢 Single-Person Company:** Hack23 AB is operated by CEO/Founder James Pether Sörling. Our ISMS demonstrates that enterprise-grade security is achievable through innovative compensating controls: temporal separation, automation, external validation, and audit trail preservation.

**Note:** The hack23.com website was registered in 2008 by the CEO, operating as an independent professional before formally establishing Hack23 AB in June 2025.

As CEO with CISM/CISSP certifications and three decades of experience, I've structured Hack23 AB around a fundamental principle: **our Information Security Management System (ISMS) is not separate from our business - it IS our business model.** This integration allows us to deliver security consulting services while simultaneously developing products that demonstrate these principles in action.

Our commitment to transparency extends beyond our open-source projects. This ISMS documentation itself serves as a testament to our belief that security through obscurity is a failed strategy. True security comes from robust processes, continuous improvement, and a culture where every decision considers security implications.

*— James Pether Sörling, CEO/Founder*
