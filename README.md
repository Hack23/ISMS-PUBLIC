## üéØ **Purpose Statement**

Hack23 AB's core philosophy is that **transparency enhances security rather than diminishing it.** This document outlines our strategy for making our Information Security Management System (ISMS) public, demonstrating our expertise and building trust, while carefully protecting sensitive information that could introduce risk.

This plan defines what is considered public, what is confidential, and the rationale for each decision.

---

## üìú **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Default to Public:** Policies, frameworks, and high-level procedures will be public unless a specific, documented risk is identified.
2.  **Demonstrate, Don't Expose:** The goal is to showcase our security maturity and processes, not to reveal secrets that could be exploited.
3.  **Redact, Don't Hide:** When a document contains a mix of public and sensitive information, we will redact the sensitive parts and publish the rest.
4.  **Clarity and Rationale:** The reason for keeping any information confidential will be clearly documented internally.

2.  **Create Public Version:** A copy of the document is made for public release.
3.  **Apply Redactions:** Based on the table above, sensitive information is removed or replaced with generic descriptions (e.g., `[REDACTED]`, `[Internal Procedure]`).
