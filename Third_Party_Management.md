## 🎯 **Purpose Statement**

**At Hack23 AB, our Third Party Management Policy transforms traditional vendor oversight into evidence-based competitive intelligence.** Our systematic supplier governance framework serves a dual purpose: protecting our operations while demonstrating to clients our professional approach to supply chain security through verifiable documentation.

Every supplier assessment documented in [🔗 SUPPLIER.md](./SUPPLIER.md), every service cataloged in [💻 Asset Register](./Asset_Register.md), and every risk treatment decision showcases our cybersecurity consulting methodology in practice. Our transparency in third-party management creates unprecedented supply chain visibility that differentiates us in the cybersecurity consulting market.

This evidence-based approach demonstrates that comprehensive third-party risk management enables rather than constrains business innovation and growth, transforming what is typically hidden compliance overhead into visible competitive advantage through documented excellence.

*— James Pether Sörling, CEO/Founder*

## 🔍 **Purpose & Scope**

### Purpose
This policy establishes the systematic framework for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring third-party risks across all supplier relationships, with all evidence documented in supporting registers to ensure business continuity while enabling strategic partnerships.

### Scope
This policy applies to:
- All suppliers requiring comprehensive assessment per strategic classification tiers
- All third-party services integrated during onboarding and operational phases  
- All business relationships involving data sharing, system integration, or process dependencies
- All outsourced functions supporting our four business lines: cybersecurity consulting, compliance management, civic engagement, and educational gaming

### Evidence Documentation Framework
- **[🔗 SUPPLIER.md](./SUPPLIER.md)** — Authoritative evidence of detailed supplier assessments, Porter's Five Forces analysis, and strategic classification implementation
- **[💻 Asset Register](./Asset_Register.md)** — Evidence of supplier onboarding, service integration, and comprehensive classification badge application
- **[📉 Risk Register](./Risk_Register.md)** — Evidence of third-party risk identification, assessment, and treatment effectiveness
- **[🏷️ Classification Framework](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md)** — Methodology for business impact analysis driving all supplier management decisions

---

## 🏗️ **Evidence-Based Management Framework**

### 📊 **Strategic Classification Approach**

Our third-party management operationalizes the [🏷️ Classification Framework](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md) through systematic evidence collection documented in [🔗 SUPPLIER.md](./SUPPLIER.md):
