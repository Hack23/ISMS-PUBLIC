**✅ Disposal Checklist:**
1. **Data Backup:** Verify critical data backed up to cloud
2. **Asset Deregistration:** Remove from [Asset Register](./Asset_Register.md)
3. **Account Removal:** Deactivate associated accounts and services
4. **License Recovery:** Recover software licenses if transferable
5. **Data Wiping:** Perform appropriate data destruction method
6. **Physical Disposal:** Use certified e-waste disposal service
7. **Documentation:** Document disposal method and date
8. **Verification:** Obtain certificate of destruction for sensitive devices

**Donation and Resale Considerations:**
- Only donate/resell devices with successful secure wipe
- Remove all identifying labels and asset tags
- Factory reset insufficient for devices containing sensitive data
- Consider physical destruction over resale for highly sensitive equipment
- Document disposition method for audit purposes

## 🚨 **Physical Security Incidents**

### 📢 **Reporting Physical Security Events**

[![Incident Reporting](https://img.shields.io/badge/🚨_Reporting-Immediate_Required-red?style=flat-square)](./Incident_Response_Plan.md) [![Response Procedures](https://img.shields.io/badge/🔄_Response-Standard_Procedures-blue?style=flat-square)]() [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/📝_Documentation-Complete_Records-green?style=flat-square)]()

**Reportable Physical Security Events:**

**🔴 Critical (Immediate Report):**
- Device theft or loss (laptop, phone, backup media)
- Unauthorized access to home office
- Natural disaster affecting equipment
- Fire or water damage to IT equipment
- Device seizure by authorities
- Suspected tampering with devices

**🟡 Important (Report Within 24 Hours):**
- Suspicious visitors or social engineering attempts
- Environmental issues affecting equipment (overheating, humidity)
- Equipment malfunction suggesting tampering
- Unusual physical access patterns
- Lost authentication tokens or access devices

**🟢 Low Priority (Report During Normal Review):**
- Minor equipment damage
- Environmental concerns (but no damage)
- Near-miss incidents (prevented theft, avoided damage)

### 🔄 **Incident Response Procedures**

Follow [Incident Response Plan](./Incident_Response_Plan.md) with physical security considerations:

**Device Theft Response:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Report theft to local police
   - Initiate remote wipe procedures (if configured)
   - Change credentials for services accessed from device
   - Notify clients if customer data potentially exposed
   - Document incident details

2. **Assessment:**
   - Determine what data was on device
   - Assess data protection (encryption status)
   - Evaluate business impact per [Classification Framework](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md)
   - Identify required notifications (GDPR breach reporting if applicable)

3. **Recovery:**
   - Restore data from backup per [Backup Recovery Policy](./Backup_Recovery_Policy.md)
   - Deploy replacement device with secure configuration
   - Update [Asset Register](./Asset_Register.md)
   - Insurance claim if applicable

4. **Lessons Learned:**
   - Document incident and response
   - Identify prevention opportunities
   - Update security controls if needed
   - Update this policy if necessary
