## 🎯 **Purpose Statement**

**Hack23 AB's** Mobile Device Management Policy demonstrates that **enterprise-grade mobile security doesn't require enterprise infrastructure.** As a single-person founder operation, our approach proves that systematic mobile device controls can be pragmatic, effective, and aligned with both security best practices and the [Discordian philosophy of mobile security](https://www.hack23.com/discordian-mobile-device.html).

**BYOD means "Bring Your Own Disaster"** - but only if devices remain unmanaged. This policy establishes practical controls for personal mobile devices that access company email and data, implementing the five essential MDM controls: enrollment, policy enforcement, app management, remote wipe capability, and monitoring.

Our transparent approach serves dual purposes: protecting our own operations while demonstrating to clients that effective mobile security is achievable regardless of organization size.

*— James Pether Sörling, CEO/Founder*

## 🍎 **The Discordian Philosophy: BYOD Reality**

> *"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Your phone bypasses the firewall."*

Mobile devices bypass perimeters. They roam networks. They install apps. They get lost. They get stolen. They access company email and then visit malicious websites.

**Our Approach:** Accept the reality of personal devices, implement pragmatic controls, and maintain the ability to protect corporate data when devices are compromised.

## 🛡️ **The Five Essential MDM Controls**

Our implementation of industry-standard mobile device management controls, adapted for single-person founder operations:

### 1️⃣ **Device Enrollment & Inventory**

**Principle:** *Register before access. Know what's connecting.*

#### Current Implementation
- **📱 Mobile Devices:** iOS/Android devices enrolled in AWS WorkMail MDM before email access granted
- **🖥️ Workstations:** Ubuntu LTS laptops tracked in [Asset Register](./Asset_Register.md)
- **🔐 Authentication:** All devices require MFA via Google Authenticator or hardware tokens
- **📝 Inventory:** Devices documented in Asset Register with:
  - Device type and OS version
  - Purpose (email, development, testing)
  - Last known location/usage
  - Enrollment status and date

#### Enrollment Process
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'base',
    'themeVariables': {
      'primaryColor': '#4CAF50',

**Selective Wipe (Corporate Data Only):**
1. Access AWS WorkMail admin console
2. Select compromised device
3. Initiate selective wipe (removes email, contacts, calendar only)
4. Verify wipe completion
5. Document incident in [Incident Response Plan](./Incident_Response_Plan.md)
6. Update [Asset Register](./Asset_Register.md) status

**Full Device Wipe (Entire Device):**
- Available via AWS WorkMail for complete device reset
- Used when device theft suspected or higher-risk scenario
- Personal data loss acceptable in critical security scenarios

#### Workstation Wipe Procedures

**Remote Scenario (Device Accessible):**
1. Initiate remote connection (if available)
2. Verify backups are current in AWS S3
3. Execute secure deletion of critical data
4. Disable all authentication credentials
5. Document in incident log

**Lost/Stolen Scenario:**
1. Immediately disable all credentials (AWS, GitHub, Google)
2. Report to authorities if theft suspected
3. Verify LUKS encryption prevents data access
4. Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
5. Procure replacement device and restore from backups

#### Wipe Decision Matrix

| 🎯 Scenario | 📱 Mobile Action | 🖥️ Workstation Action | ⏱️ Response Time |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Device Lost - Likely Recoverable** | Selective wipe + monitoring | Disable credentials + monitoring | ⚡ Immediate (1 hour) |
