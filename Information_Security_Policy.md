## 🎯 **Purpose Statement**

**Hack23 AB** represents a new paradigm in technology companies - where enterprise-grade security expertise directly enables innovation rather than constraining it. This Information Security Policy embodies our fundamental principle: **our ISMS is not separate from our business - it IS our business model.**

As a cybersecurity consulting company, our own security posture serves as both our operational foundation and our marketing demonstration. Every security control we implement, every process we document, and every risk we mitigate showcases our expertise to potential clients while protecting our own valuable assets.

Our commitment to transparency extends to this policy itself - demonstrating that true security comes from robust processes, continuous improvement, and a culture where security considerations are integral to every business decision.

*— James Pether Sörling, CEO/Founder*
