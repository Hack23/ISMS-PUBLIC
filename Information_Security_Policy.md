## 🎯 **Purpose Statement**

**Hack23 AB** represents a new paradigm in technology companies - where enterprise-grade security expertise directly enables innovation rather than constraining it. This Information Security Policy embodies our fundamental principle: **our ISMS is not separate from our business - it IS our business model.**

As a cybersecurity consulting company, our own security posture serves as both our operational foundation and our marketing demonstration. Every security control we implement, every process we document, and every risk we mitigate showcases our expertise to potential clients while protecting our own valuable assets.

Our commitment to transparency extends to this policy itself - demonstrating that true security comes from robust processes, continuous improvement, and a culture where security considerations are integral to every business decision.

*— James Pether Sörling, CEO/Founder*

## 🤖 **AI-First Operations Governance**

Hack23 AB operates an AI-first operating model where GitHub Copilot custom agents are core strategic enablers for enterprise-grade delivery. This section establishes governance requirements; detailed architecture and workflows are documented in [Information Security Strategy](./Information_Security_Strategy.md#-ai-first-operations-strategy).

### Governance Principles

**Human Oversight:** CEO maintains ultimate authority over all agent activities. All agent-created pull requests require CEO approval before merge.

**ISMS Integration:** All agents load ISMS-PUBLIC policies as mandatory context, ensuring compliance with [AI Policy](./AI_Policy.md), [Secure Development Policy](./Secure_Development_Policy.md), and [Open Source Policy](./Open_Source_Policy.md).

**Least Privilege:** Agents operate with minimal tool sets and permissions required for their designated functions.

**Audit Trail:** All agent activities are logged through GitHub's audit mechanisms, enabling complete traceability.

### Agent Tiers

1. **Curator-Agent** — Maintains agent fleet configuration (profiles, MCP configs, workflows)
2. **Task Agents** — Product-specific analysis and issue creation with ISMS policy mappings
3. **Specialist Agents** — Domain-specific implementation (security, development, testing, documentation)

### CEO Control Points

- Sets strategic direction for agent analysis priorities
- Approves all agent-created pull requests
- Approves all workflow and configuration changes
- Retains responsibility for production changes and policy evolution

As a single-person organization, Hack23 AB implements comprehensive compensating controls documented in the dedicated [🚫 Segregation of Duties Policy](./Segregation_of_Duties_Policy.md).

The policy defines:
- **15 Incompatible Role Pairs**: System Admin/Auditor, Developer/Deployer, Financial Approver/Processor, and 12 additional critical separations
- **Compensating Controls**: Temporal separation, tool-based enforcement, audit trails, external validation, automated anomaly detection
- **Risk-Based Workflow**: Differentiated approval processes for high/medium/low risk changes
- **Monitoring Framework**: Continuous, quarterly, and annual audit procedures
- **Break-Glass Procedures**: Emergency response protocols with enhanced logging

See [🚫 Segregation of Duties Policy](./Segregation_of_Duties_Policy.md) for complete matrix, workflows, and control details.
