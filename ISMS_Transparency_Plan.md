## 🎯 **Purpose Statement**

**Hack23 AB's** core philosophy is that **transparency enhances security rather than diminishing it.** This document outlines our strategy for making our Information Security Management System (ISMS) public, demonstrating our expertise and building trust, while carefully protecting sensitive information that could introduce risk.

This plan defines what is considered public, what is confidential, and the processes for maintaining our commitment to security through transparency.

*— James Pether Sörling, CEO/Founder*

## 📜 **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Default to Public:** Policies, frameworks, and high-level procedures will be public unless a specific, documented risk is identified.
2.  **Demonstrate, Don't Expose:** The goal is to showcase our security maturity and processes, not to reveal secrets that could be exploited.
3.  **Redact, Don't Hide:** When a document contains a mix of public and sensitive information, we will redact the sensitive parts and publish the rest.
4.  **Clarity and Rationale:** The reason for keeping any information confidential will be clearly documented internally.

## 🔧 **Redaction and Publication Process**

### Radical Transparency Approach

Hack23 AB practices **radical transparency** - we publish complete ISMS documents with only specific sensitive values redacted. This demonstrates our security maturity and operational excellence while protecting only the most sensitive information.

**What We Publish (Everything):**
- ✅ Complete processes, procedures, and technical details
- ✅ All system configurations, architectures, and operational procedures
- ✅ All contact information (roles, escalation paths, response procedures)
- ✅ All supplier names, assessments, and security postures
- ✅ All risk assessments, risk details, and mitigation strategies
- ✅ Complete asset inventories with all systems and services

**What We Redact (Minimal):**
- 🔒 Specific credentials, API keys, passwords, tokens
- 🔒 Specific account numbers, account IDs (replaced with `[REDACTED]`)
- 🔒 Specific financial impact amounts in risks (e.g., "$1.8M" → `[REDACTED]`)
- 🔒 Specific contract pricing and commercial terms
- 🔒 Personal phone numbers and personal email addresses

### Publication Process

1.  **Create Internal Version:** The complete document is created as the "source of truth."
2.  **Create Public Version:** An identical copy is made for public release.
3.  **Apply Minimal Redactions:** Only specific sensitive VALUES are replaced with `[REDACTED]` - structure and content remain intact.
4.  **Add Redaction Header:** Public versions include standardized header badges and notice (see below).
5.  **Review:** The CEO reviews to ensure only appropriate values are redacted.
6.  **Publish:** The document is published to the public GitHub repository.

### ISMS-PUBLIC Header Requirements

All documents in the [ISMS-PUBLIC](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC) repository must include the following elements after the standard document badges:

**Required Header Badges:**
```markdown
<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS/blob/main/ISMS_Transparency_Plan.md"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/🔓_PUBLIC_REDACTED_VERSION-Per_Transparency_Plan-blue?style=for-the-badge" alt="Public Redacted Version"/></a>
  <a href="https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS/blob/main/ISMS_Transparency_Plan.md"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/📋_Redaction_Policy-ISMS__Transparency__Plan-informational?style=for-the-badge" alt="Transparency Plan"/></a>
</p>
```

**Required Redaction Notice:**
```markdown
> ⚠️ **PUBLIC REDACTED VERSION:** This document has been redacted per our [ISMS Transparency Plan](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS/blob/main/ISMS_Transparency_Plan.md). Sensitive values are replaced with `[REDACTED]`. Complete unredacted version maintained in private ISMS repository.
```

**Document-Specific Redaction Notices:**
- **Asset Register:** "Sensitive values (personal emails, account IDs, financial amounts)"
- **Risk Register:** "Sensitive values (financial impact amounts, ALE/SLE/VaR figures)"
- **Supplier Security Posture:** "Sensitive values (contract pricing, monthly costs, financial impact amounts)"

### Redaction Examples
- **Credentials:** `password: "abc123"` becomes `password: [REDACTED]`
- **Account Numbers:** `Account: 172017021075` becomes `Account: [REDACTED]`
- **Financial Risk Values:** `ALE: €65,700` becomes `ALE: [REDACTED]`
- **Personal Contact:** `CEO: +46-XXX-XXX` becomes `CEO: [REDACTED]`
- **Contract Pricing:** `$50/month` becomes `[REDACTED]/month`

**Everything else remains public and unredacted.**
