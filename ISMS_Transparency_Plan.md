## 🎯 **Purpose Statement**

**Hack23 AB's** core philosophy is that **transparency enhances security rather than diminishing it.** This document outlines our strategy for making our Information Security Management System (ISMS) public, demonstrating our expertise and building trust, while carefully protecting sensitive information that could introduce risk.

This plan defines what is considered public, what is confidential, and the processes for maintaining our commitment to security through transparency.

*— James Pether Sörling, CEO/Founder*

## 📜 **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Default to Public:** Policies, frameworks, and high-level procedures will be public unless a specific, documented risk is identified.
2.  **Demonstrate, Don't Expose:** The goal is to showcase our security maturity and processes, not to reveal secrets that could be exploited.
3.  **Redact, Don't Hide:** When a document contains a mix of public and sensitive information, we will redact the sensitive parts and publish the rest.
4.  **Clarity and Rationale:** The reason for keeping any information confidential will be clearly documented internally.

## 🔧 **Redaction and Publication Process**

1.  **Create Internal Version:** The complete, unredacted document is created and stored in a secure, internal repository. This is the "source of truth."
2.  **Create Public Version:** A copy of the document is made for public release.
3.  **Apply Redactions:** Based on the table above, sensitive information is removed or replaced with generic descriptions (e.g., `[REDACTED]`, `[Generic Example]`, `[Representative Values]`).
4.  **Review:** The public version is reviewed by the CEO to ensure no sensitive information remains.
5.  **Publish:** The sanitized version is published to the public GitHub repository.

### Redaction Examples
- **Financial Data:** Replace specific costs with ranges or generic examples (e.g., "$50K+" becomes "High switching costs")
- **Risk Exposure:** Remove specific dollar amounts, keep relative severity (e.g., "Critical risk" without "$1.8M exposure")
- **Supplier Details:** Use generic examples instead of actual supplier names and contracts
- **Technical Details:** Remove IP addresses, account IDs, specific configurations
